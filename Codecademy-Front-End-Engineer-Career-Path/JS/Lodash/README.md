##Lodash

</br>

#### In this project, you will be implementing some of the most exciting functionality from the widely-popular lodash.js library which provides many methods that add new functionality for numbers, strings, objects, and arrays.

#### If you wanted to use this library in your own projects right now, you could load it, using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) link, in the <head> of your project’s index.html file , like so:

However, implementing the methods from lodash on your own is an invaluable exercise in problem-solving and a great way to understand how the methods work! We’ve selected ten methods for you to implement and, in implementing each method, you will follow these four steps:

#### Specify the functionality of the method we are implementing
#### 1. Ideate a game plan for how to implement this functionality in code
#### 2. Implement our game plan
#### 3. Test our code to ensure it works as expected
#### 4. We encourage you to try to complete the “Ideate” and “Implement” steps on your own before consulting our suggestions for each. It may be difficult at points, but working through difficult problems on your own will be incredibly helpful in your journey to become a stronger developer. Once you’ve come up with a solution on your own, or if you have become so stuck you are no longer being productive, check out our steps to see our suggestions for how to solve the problem.
