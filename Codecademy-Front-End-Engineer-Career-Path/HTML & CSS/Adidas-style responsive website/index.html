          STORIES, STYLES AND SPORTSWEAR AT ADIDAS SPORTS SHOP, SINCE 1949
        </h6>
        <p>
          Sport keeps us fit. Keeps you mindful. Brings us together. Through
          sport we have the power to change lives. Whether it is through stories
          of inspiring athletes. Helping you to get up and get moving. Sporting
          goods featuring the latest technologies, to up your performance. Beat
          your PB. Our sports shop offers a home to the runner, the basketball
          player, the soccer kid, the fitness enthusiast. The weekend hiker that
          loves to escape the city. The yoga teacher that spreads the moves. The
          3-Stripes are seen in the music scene. On stage, at festivals. The
          clothing at our sports store keeps you focussed before that whistle
          blows. During the race. And at the finish lines. We’re here to support
          creators. Improve their game. Their lives. And change the world.
          <br /><br />

          adidas is about more than sportswear and workout clothes. We partner

          the sports apparel and style that match their athletic needs, while
          keeping sustainability in mind. We’re here to support creators.
          Improve their game. Create change. And we think about the impact we
          have on our world.

        <h6>YOUR SPORT SHOP, WITH ACTIVEWEAR FOR ANY SPORT</h6>
        <p>
          adidas designs workout clothes for and with athletes of all kinds.
          Creators, who love to change the game. Challenge conventions. Break
          the rules and define new ones. Then break them again. We supply teams
          and individuals with sports gear pre-match. To stay focussed. We
          design activewear to get you to the finish line. To win the match. We
          are the sport shop for women, with bras and tights made for purpose.
          From low to high impact. We design, innovate and iterate. Testing new
          technologies in action. On the pitch, the tracks, the court, the pool.
          Retro sportswear inspires new streetwear essentials. Like NMD, and our
          Firebird tracksuits. Classic sports models are brought back to life.
          Like Stan Smith. And Superstar. Now seen on the streets and the
          stages.
          <br /><br />
          Through our collections we blur the borders between high fashion and
          high performance. Like our adidas by Stella McCartney athletic
          clothing collection – designed to look the part inside and outside of
          the gym. Or some of our adidas Originals lifestyle pieces, that can be
          worn as sportswear too. Our lives are constantly changing. Becoming
          more and more versatile. And adidas designs with that in mind.
